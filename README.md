# **What is data science?**

🔹Data science is the field of study that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and programming to extract knowledge and insights from data.It's the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting large amounts of data to uncover hidden patterns and trends. 

🔹Data scientists construct questions around specific data sets and then use tools such as data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to find patterns, create predictive models, and develop insights that guide business decision-making.  
Here’s an enhanced and professional README for your GitHub repository:
